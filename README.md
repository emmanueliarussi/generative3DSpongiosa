# Generative Modelling of 3D in-silico Spongiosa with Controllable Micro-Structural Parameters
Code, data, and trained models from the [MICCAI 2020](https://miccai2020.org/en/default.asp) paper. We developed a method to create micro-structural bone samples in-silico that 1) contain realistic structures, and 2) allow to steer the properties to simulate changes ofmicro-structural parameters from deterioration or medical bone treatment.
